## Assignment 1
#### Task 1
Make a dataset of (28 × 28 × 3) images of straight lines on a black background with the
following variations:
1. Length - 7 (short) and 15 (long) pixels.
2. Width - 1 (thin) and 3 (thick) pixels.
3. Angle with X-axis - Angle θ ∈ [0
, 180 degrees
) at intervals of 15 degrees
.
4. Color - Red and Blue.

#### Task 2
Given masses and initial positions & velocities of 100 particles, you are required to find the final
positions and velocities of particles when the minimum distance between any pair of particles
falls below a given threshold. The only working forces are Newtonian Gravitational Forces, in
a two-dimensional rectangular coordinate system.

#### Task 3
You are required to make a simple fully connected network to classify the MNIST dataset and
the dataset you made in part 1. The caveat here is that you can not use layer APIs already
provided in your library of choice. You will need to code a dense layer API as exhaustive as
possible using in-built operations for matrix multiplication, etc. Refer to the Tensorflow Dense
Layer API, for reference.
